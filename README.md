## Introduction

### Organisatio Overview

Tyne & Wear Passenger Transport Users Group (TWPTUG) is voluntary community group that campaigns for the full integration of public transport 
in Tyne & Wear, such as rail, Metro, bus and ferry with private transport modes such as of walking, cycling and driving. TWPTUG believes such 
integration can only be achieved through local public ownership of public transport. TWPTUG covers the five boroughs of Tyne & Wear, namely 
Newcastle, Gateshead, North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Sunderland. Only Newcastle and North Tyneside are running at the moment. Gateshead and
South Shields did start up but have since stopped due to various reasons like members moving out of the area, ill-health, and the distraction
of other issues affecting the community like hospital closures. TWPTUG is run by a Management Committee, the members of which are elected 
by individuals within the local groups and partner organisations. TWPTUG’s members include individuals as well as a number of partner 
organisations such as cycling groups, pensioners’ groups, union community branches and other community transport groups from across the UK. 
TWPTUG also works closely with bus operating companies, local authorities and Nexus to influence general transport policy. Nexus is the Passenger 
Transport Executive for Tyne & Wear, which directly operates the Metro and the Shields Ferry on behalf of the five boroughs and secures some 
essential local bus services ran by the private bus operators.

### Layouts

The files shown below are stored in the __Project Documentation_ folder in the GitHub repository. The layout diagrams show both wide screen and mobile layouts. I drew out the Home page layout first, but I didn't stick to it as it didn't look right on the page. The later pages reflect the new design. Even then, I haven't followed the later designs to the letter, but repositioned elements according to what looked right in practice. I did not design layouts for the Acknowledgement page as it consisted only of a simple banner message and a Return button. Similarly for the 'Under construction' pages, as these were cloned from the Acknowledgement page, though styled with a different background colour.
