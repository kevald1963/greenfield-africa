            <p>
                Applying is easy. Just email <a class="email-link" href="mailto:kevin_alderson@yahoo.co.uk">
                kevin_alderson@yahoo.co.uk</a> with your chosen destination, type of volunteering activity (or
                activities, if you wish to more than one), the approximate departure date, and the duration of stay.
            </p>
            <p>
                On receipt of your email we will confirm if your choices are available, or suggest possible alternatives
                if your choices are not available. There is no obligation at this stage. We just want to be sure we can
                accommodate your choices before proceeding any further.
            </p>
            <p>
