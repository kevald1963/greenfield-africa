                To apply, please email <a class="email-link inline" href="mailto:kevin_alderson@yahoo.co.uk">kevin_alderson@yahoo.co.uk</a>
                with your chosen destination, type of volunteering activity (or activities, if you wish to do more than one),

                We want to be sure we can accommodate your choices before proceeding further, so on receipt of your
                email we will check and confirm if your choices are available. If they are not, we will offer some
                alternatives instead. There is no obligation to proceed if they are not suitable.

                Once we have offered you a suitable placement, and you decide to join our program by paying our fee,
                then we will send you our <b>pre-departure pack</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This document will provide you all the details and advice you need to obtain a visa, volunteer travel
                insurance, vaccinations, medication, etc. We recommend you give yourself at least 8 weeks between
                enrolling on our program and your planned departure date, to book flights and get all necessary
                paperwork before you depart. We will, of course provide support and answer any queries you have during
                this period.
