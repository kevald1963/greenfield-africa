                Fees & Costs</a> page before proceeding. Before applying, please ensure you have a passport that is valid
                for another six months <b>after</b> your planned departure date from the country you want to volunteer in.
                This is called the 6-month rule and is applied by many African countries.

            <p class="inline">
                To apply, please email <a class="email-link inline" href="mailto:kevin_alderson@yahoo.co.uk">kevin_alderson@yahoo.co.uk</a>
                with your chosen destination, type of volunteering activity (or activities, if you wish to do more than one),
                the approximate departure date, and the duration of stay. Please mark the email subject as "Greenfield

                We want to be sure we can accommodate your choices before proceeding further, so on receipt of your
                email we will check and confirm if your choices are available. If they are not, we will offer some
                alternatives instead. There is no obligation to proceed if they are not suitable.

                Once you have accepted our offer, you must confirm your enrolment by paying a deposit of £50. Please
                note this is non-refundable. We will then send you our <b>pre-departure pack</b>. This document will
                provide you all the details and advice you need to obtain a visa, volunteer travel insurance,
                vaccinations, medication, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please read our short <a class="general-link" href="{{ url_for('termsandconditions') }}">Terms and
                Conditions</a> page before paying your deposit.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>For Ghana,</b> we recommend you give yourself at least 8 weeks between enrolling on our program and
                your planned departure date, to book flights and get all necessary paperwork before you travel,
                especially the visa.
                <b>For Kenya,</b> we recommend 4 weeks minimum as the visa application is much quicker. We will provide
                support and answer any queries you have during this period.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Please note the fee balance is due 8 weeks before departure.</b> We will send a reminder email to
                you before the balance is due.
