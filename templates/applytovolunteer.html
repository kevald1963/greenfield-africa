            <p>
                Before you start to apply, please make sure you have read our other pages on the destinations where
                we operate and also the types of volunteering activities we offer.
            </p>
            <p>
                PLEASE NOTE that we require a fee from our international volunteers in order to cover the costs associated
                with their stay in Ghana e.g. airport pick-up and drop-off, transport to & from projects, accommodation
                and food. To ensure their welfare during their stay we also employ a local crew leader. Some 80% of the
                volunteer fee is used to cover these costs. The remaining balance of the is used to fund the project they
                are working on. The types of costs we cover are listed in the orange panel.
            </p>
            <p>
                The directors, trustees and officers of Greenfield Africa work voluntarily and receive NO remuneration
                from  fees paid by international volunteers. The only money spent on employment is in the host country
                i.e. to pay for the services of the crew leader and to hire local tradespeople and other experts, where
                technical guidance or support is needed e.g. in the construction of buildings, such as schools or
                clinics. Any further financial support given to the project by volunteers from personal donations or
                fundraising is more than welcome.
            </p>

PROJECT COSTS
These are the costs associated with your chosen volunteering program. They vary widely, depending on the project type and the host country:
BUILDING & REFURBISHMENT – cement, stones, tools, personal protective equipment (PPE), wood, sheet roofing, fixings, hire of tradespeople, etc. These are paid for directly by Greenfield Africa. Most of the labour for construction projects is given freely by villagers and, of course, volunteers.
TEACHING & ORPHANAGE CARE – funds donated by Greenfield to buy books, stationery, toys, games, arts & crafts materials, sports equipment, classroom or orphanage furniture, etc.
MEDICAL & HEALTHCARE – funds donated by Greenfield to buy medication, spectacles, basic medical equipment (syringes, stethoscopes, etc.), clinic furniture, etc.
SPORTS - funds donated by Greenfield to buy or hire sports equipment, team strips, use of sports facilities (where applicable), etc.
Accommodation
There are two types of accommodation on all our projects depending on your chosen project placement. The accommodation in the villages is different
                from those in the urban areas. It is quite different from the house we use on our urban placements. More information on this will be told during your orientation. There are always separate male and female bedrooms, each with mosquito nets hung above from the roof. Sometimes, you may have a wooden locally made bed with a mattress with bedsheet and pillows but not always. There is always an availability of water, however, if the water runs out, you will be shown the nearest stream or local stand pipe from which to fetch it with a bucket. There is someone available to make your meals so do not worry on that score. The food served will be local dishes. Please do not expect pizza, burgers or roast beef dinners on a Sunday!
Weekends
The weekends are there for you to travel out of project to visit other places if you wish. There are numerous places to visits. Water falls, monkey sanctuaries and the sights and sounds of the capital cities, are but a few that we could mention. More information will be provided on local and national attractions during your orientation meeting. Our competent and committed Project Director, Gideon and your designated crew leaders are very knowledgeable about tourism in your project destinations and will help you organise your weekends. Please note that all costs connected with weekend travel are not included in the project fee and must be borne by the volunteer.
