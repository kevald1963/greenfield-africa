                This is offered specifically at Project Elimu in the district of Kibra, Nairobi, Kenya. Apart from
                teaching and leading musical exercise classes, volunteers may also assist in other activities offered
                at Project Elimu's centre such as teaching IT skills and basic English and Maths. Volunteers in Kibra
                may also opt to share their time with another NGO in Kibra, Greencard Mtaani, where organising
                sports matches and developing children's sports skills can be pursued.
