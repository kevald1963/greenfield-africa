            <p>
                Apart from running volunteering programmes, Greenfield Foundation provides small grants to various
                projects in Ghana and also to our partner NGO in Kenya, Greencard Mtaani. In time, we hope to extend
                grants to projects in Malawi. We are currently in negotiations with an NGO in that country.
            </p>
