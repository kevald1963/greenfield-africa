                <b>Please note that you must be 18 or over to apply to volunteer with us.</b> Before you start to apply,
                please make sure you have read our other pages on the destinations where we operate and also the
                types of volunteering activities we offer.
            </p>
            <p>
                PLEASE NOTE that we require a fee from our international volunteers in order to cover the costs associated
                with their stay e.g. airport pick-up and drop-off, transport to & from projects, accommodation
                and food. To ensure their welfare during their stay we also employ a local crew leader. Some 80% of the
                volunteer fee is used to cover these costs. The remaining balance of the fee is used to fund the project
                they are working on. The types of costs we cover are listed below.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our programmes durations are between 2 and 6 weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>We do not charge an initial registration fee for our programmes</b> but instead charge a flat fee
                depending on the duration of your placement. Please note that we require a deposit, the amount of
                which depends on your placement duration. This is non-refundable due to advance preparation costs.
                The deposit will be deducted from the fee total when we request your final balance.

            <h5>TURING SCHEME GRANTS</h5>
            <p>
                <b>Northumbria University students</b> please note that a Turing Scheme grant can be claimed for KENYA
                through your university. The maximum basic grant is £467 for 4 weeks for Summer 2026. A pro rata amount
                is available for 2 and 3 week durations. Other support is available for certain disadvantaged students.
                Please inquire with Student Services for further information. Volunteer placements under Turing must
                take place between 1st June and 31st August. We only have 5 grant-assisted places available for Kenya
                in 2026.
            </p>
            <p>
                For GHANA, the Turing Scheme grant is NOT available. However, the costs in rural Ghana are much less
                than in the capital of Kenya, where our partner NGO operates. Therefore, we have priced our fees lower
                for Ghana such that, even without a grant, the overall cost is about the same as Kenya. Other than
                staffing resources. there are no restrictions on the number of students we can assign to our programmes
                in Ghana. Also, volunteer placements for Ghana can be taken virtually any time, though we advise you to
                avoid the dry season, between December and March, particularly if doing sports or building, as it can
                be very hot.
            </p>

            <h5>SUBSEQUENT VISITS</h5>
            <p>
                Please note any subsequent volunteer visits attract a discount of 20% on fees that are in force at the time of booking. This applies
                to any duration of stay on the very first visit.

                These are the <b>types</b> of costs associated with your chosen volunteering program. The remainder
                of your fee, after costs for your welfare, etc., are spent on the project, or projects, you are working
                on. It is hard to put a figure on these items because they vary so widely, depending on the project type
                and the host country. Items that have to be imported are particularly vulnerable to inflation caused by
                market, or government, devaluations in the local currency.
