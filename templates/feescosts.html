            <p>
                Before you start to apply, please make sure you have read our other pages on the destinations where
                we operate and also the types of volunteering activities we offer.
            </p>
            <p>
                PLEASE NOTE that we require a fee from our international volunteers in order to cover the costs associated
                with their stay e.g. airport pick-up and drop-off, transport to & from projects, accommodation
                and food. To ensure their welfare during their stay we also employ a local crew leader. Some 80% of the
                volunteer fee is used to cover these costs. The remaining balance of the fee is used to fund the project
                they are working on. The types of costs we cover are listed below.
            </p>
            <p>
                The directors, trustees and officers of Greenfield Africa work voluntarily and receive NO remuneration
                from fees paid by international volunteers. The only money spent on employment is in the host country
                i.e. to pay for the services of the crew leader and to hire local tradespeople and other experts, where
                technical guidance or support is needed e.g. in the construction of buildings, such as schools or
                clinics. Any further financial support given to the project by volunteers from personal donations or
                fundraising is more than welcome.
            </p>

            <p>
                These are the <b>types</b> of costs associated with your chosen volunteering program. The remainder
                of your fee, after costs for your welfare, etc., are spent on the project, or projects, you are working
                on. It is hard to put a figure on these items because they vary so widely, depending on the project type
                and the host country. Items that have to be imported are particularly vulnerable to inflation caused by
                market, or government, devaluations in the local currency.

                the date of your trip i.e. they get more expensive as the departure date gets closer. Once you
                have paid your volunteer fee, we recommend that you book your flights straight away to avoid
                extra expense.
