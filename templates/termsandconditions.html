                        These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) apply to all volunteering services provided by Greenfield

                    <p>
                        That's the only legalese we use! Nobody likes reading the small print but our Ts & Cs are
                        designed to be clear and transparent as possible. Please contact us if they are not.

                    <p>
                        After being offered a place by us, and confirming your wish to join us as an international
                        volunteer, you must pay a deposit to secure your place. The deposit is non-refundable, if
                        cancelled by you. <b>The deposit amount is dependent on the duration of your placement.</b>
                        Please see our Fees & Costs page for the exact amount for your chosen duration and pay
                        it by bank transfer to this account:

                        Account name: Greenfield Africa UK<br>

                    <p>
                        After your deposit has been received, we will issue you with an electronic receipt. Please
                        safely retain this in case you need to make a claim against your travel insurance.

                    <p>
                        We will send you an electronic invoice with your final balance, 10 weeks before departure.
                        You must pay this at least 8 weeks before departure, unless otherwise permitted by us. Early
                        payment helps us to cover our administration costs and timely secure accommodation, hired
                        labour and trades people, building materials, educational materials, etc. in advance of your
                        visit. Please pay your balance to the same bank account above.

                    <p>
                        It is a condition of volunteering with us, that you must purchase <b>volunteer</b> travel
                        insurance for the full duration of your placement. Please note that standard <b>tourist</b>
                        insurance
                        will not cover the types of risks that are part-and-parcel of working as a volunteer. Documentary
                        proof of possession of such insurance will need to be sent to us at least 4 weeks before your
                        departure.

                        <u>Availability of activities</u>

                    <p>
                        Although we will do our utmost to provide the activities advertised for your have chosen
                        destination, please be aware it may not be possible to provide all of them, as stated, due
                        to circumstances beyond our control, such as war, civil unrest, flood, fire, industrial
                        action, power outages, material shortages, currency volatility, etc. The local manager in
                        your destination country will try to make alternative arrangements for you, where possible.
                        By enrolling with us, you accept that some of our promoted activities may not be available,
                        and that you are prepared to engage in alternative ones that are offered.

                        <u>Cancellation of programme</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please note that the cancellation of a programme in one destination only affects that
                        particular country. We may be able to offer you a placement in our alternative destination.
                        For example, if you opted for Kenya initially, then we may be able to transfer you to a
                        placement in Ghana.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the unlikely event that your placement is cancelled by us and an alternative one is not
                        available, nor suitable to you, then we will refund your deposit in full. If you have already
                        paid your final balance, and the money has not been forwarded to cover costs in your
                        destination country, then we will refund it.

                        If it has already been transferred to your destination country then it may be difficult
                        to recover, especially if it has been spent on non-refundable accommodation deposits,
                        building materials, educational supplies, etc. African NGOs tend to spend their funding quickly
                        because of inflationary pressures. In such an event, you should claim your costs from your
                        travel insurance provider.
