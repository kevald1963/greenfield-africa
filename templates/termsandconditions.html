                        It is a condition of volunteering with us, that you must purchase <b>volunteer</b> travel
                        insurance for the full duration of your trip. Please note that standard <b>tourist</b> insurance
                        will not cover the types of risks that are part-and-parcel of working as a volunteer. Documentary
                        proof of possession of such insurance will need to be sent to us at least 4 weeks before your
                        departure.
