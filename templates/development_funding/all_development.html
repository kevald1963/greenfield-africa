            <p>
                Apart from running volunteering programmes, Greenfield Foundation also provides small grants to various
                projects in Ghana and Kenya. In Ghana, we fund projects selected by our own government-registered NGO,
                Greenfield Foundation, whereas in Kenya we currently work with a partner NGO called Greencard Mtaani.
                In time, we hope to extend our development funding programme to projects in Malawi. We are currently
                negotiating a partnership agreement with an NGO there.
            </p>
            <p>
                All our prospective, and existing, NGO partners must be registered with the relevant authorities in
                their country, in order for Greenfield to work with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The links below show what Greenfield has funded in Ghana and Kenya so far.
