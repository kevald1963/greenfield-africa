                Development of village school at Iddrisu-Krom
            </div>
            <p>
                Iddrisu-Krom is small, remote village in the Afram Plains district of Ghana.
                This development was a longer project that Greenfield undertook between 2020 and 2023. It was quite a
                difficult project for us both because of its remoteness and, also, because there were no builders
                in the village. Most of the people who live there are farmers. Nevertheless, we were determined to make
                a difference there because Iddrisu is one of the most disadvantaged communities that we know of in Ghana.
                It has no electricity, no internet, and no phone connections. Water has to be carried from a standpipe,
                a kilometer away, and which is shared with two other villages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our project included not only extending
                the village school but refurbishing the old one. We also supplied new desks for the children a long with
                educational supplies, such as books, stationery, fabrics for school uniforms, etc. After the school was
                finished we then built an accommodation block to house 3 teachers. This was to save teachers commuting
                long distances to on a daily basis, which was having a negative impact on the contact time teachers
                could have to the children.
            </p>
            <p>
                The set of photos, immediately below, show the initial work of building the school extension, such as
                casting the concrete blocks, digging the foundations, erecting the walls, and building the roof. The
                concrete blocks were actually made in the village, rather than buying them ready-made, as it was
                cheaper that way.
