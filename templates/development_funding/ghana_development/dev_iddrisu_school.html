                Development of village school at Iddrisu-Krom
            </div>
            <p>
                Iddrisu-Krom is small, remote village in the Afram Plains district of Ghana.
                This development was a longer project that Greenfield undertook between 2020 and 2023. It was quite a
                difficult project for us both because of its remoteness and, also, because there were no builders
                in the village. Most of the people who live there are farmers. Nevertheless, we were determined to make
                a difference there because Iddrisu is one of the most disadvantaged communities that we know of in Ghana.
                It has no electricity, no internet, and no phone connections. Water has to be carried from a standpipe,
                a kilometer away, and which is shared with two other villages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our project included not only extending
                the village school but refurbishing the old one. We also supplied new desks for the children a long with
                educational supplies, such as books, stationery, fabrics for school uniforms, etc. After the school was
                finished we then built an accommodation block to house 3 teachers. This was to save teachers commuting
                long distances to on a daily basis, which was having a negative impact on the contact time teachers
                could have with the children.
            </p>
            <p>
                The set of photos, immediately below, show the initial work of building the school extension, such as
                casting the concrete blocks, digging the foundations, erecting the walls, and building the roof. To
                save money, the concrete blocks were actually made in the village, rather than buying them from the
                nearest town and having them transported in.
            </p>
            <p>
                We wish to offer our sincere thanks to our donors for making this massive project possible.

            <p>A PERSONAL NOTE FROM KEVIN ALDERSON, UK COUNTRY DIRECTOR</p>
            <p>
                We would also like to extend our sincere gratitude to our Project Director, Gideon Korda, who
                generously gave time and effort to ensure this difficult project turned out so successfully.
                Even travelling to Iddrisu took many, many hours, and was all part of his stoic effort
                toward the project. I visited Ghana in November 2023, and travelled with Gideon to the project
                in Iddrisu by public transport. It involved many connections (bus, ferry, bus and taxi car) with
                many long waits in-between to get there. I now appreciate the real sacrifice that he made on behalf
                of Greenfield and Iddrisu. He not only project-managed the entire works but also participated in
                the physical construction as needed. Well done, Gids! I can't thank you enough!
