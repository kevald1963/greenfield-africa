                Greenfield raises funds from the public as well as from volunteer fees, because not
                all projects can be funded by volunteer fees, either because of the cost of imported materials or
                simply because they are too remote to send our volunteers to! Donations, large or small, are all
                welcome. They may be made as follows:
