                Greenfield Foundation raises funds from the public and other sources, as well as from volunteer fees.
                For various reasons, not all projects can be funded by volunteer fees alone. For example, because of
                the high cost of imported building materials or, simply because some projects are too remote to send
                our volunteers to. For cases like these we fund them directly, appointing a trusted local person to
                make the purchases on our behalf. Any donations, large or small, are all welcome. They may be made as
                follows:
